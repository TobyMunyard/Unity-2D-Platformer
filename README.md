# Unity-2D-Platformer
A farewell project to Unity for now as I am moving to Unreal Engine 5 to test out 3D games in much more depth. This project was largely done to ensure I haven't forgotten how to work on 2D games in case I choose to return or need these skills for work/interviews in the future. It's incredibly simple and was made in the space of only a couple hours. **This is NOT meant to represent the extent of my skills but rather to show that I have worked on 2D games and know how they work**.

## Learned/Refreshed
* Unity's UI System
* Unity's Event System
* Unity's Input Manager
* C# Coding
* 2D colliders, interactions and camera movement

## What Is Next?
I'm going to begin work on a small 3D horror game in Unreal Engine 5, check my profile for a link to the repository!
